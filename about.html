      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        The Hotel Parking System allows both hotel staff and customers to register their vehicles for parking. 
        The system requires the user to input key details such as name, mobile number, vehicle information, and upload a photo. 
        The parking data is stored securely and can be accessed later through the system's interface. 
        Our system also offers parking duration calculation and ensures that each vehicle is assigned a valid parking slot.
